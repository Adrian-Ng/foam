# Foam PKM Workspace

Welcome to your Foam-based Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) system.  
This workspace is designed for clarity, structure, and long-term thinking.

---

## Getting Started

1. Install the Foam extension in VS Code.
2. Use `Foam: Create New Note` to create your first note.
3. Open your daily note using `Foam: Open Daily Note` (template in `templates/daily.md`).
4. Create notes for key areas of life (Work, Personal, Health, Friendships, Projects).
5. Link notes using [[wikilinks]] to build a connected knowledge graph.
6. Review and update notes regularly to keep the system alive.

## Zettelkasten Workflow

Foam supports a lightweight Zettelkasten approach:

- Create **atomic notes** (one idea per file).
- Use [[wikilinks]] to connect related ideas.
- Give each note a clear, unique title or ID.
- Let structure emerge organically through links, not folders.

---

## Folder Structure

- `templates/` — Note templates (daily, zettel, project, relationship)
- `relationships/` — People, history snapshots, boundaries, scripts
