## Core Idea  
I respond strongly to films that earn their emotional and cinematic effects through perspective, structure, and craft — and I reject films that rely on shortcuts, contrivances, or unearned depth.

## Films That Earn Their Effects  

### Godzilla (2014) — Earned Cinematic Perspective  
- Commits to a strict human‑scale viewpoint, grounding spectacle in lived experience.  
- Treats Godzilla and the U.S. military as mythic “characters,” giving the film coherent dramatic logic.  
- Builds awe through restraint, perspective, and scale rather than exposition or sentimentality.

## Films That Fake Their Effects  

### A Star Is Born (2018) — Unearned Tragedy  
- Attempts a devastating ending without building emotional or psychological groundwork.  
- Characters lack interiority, making the final act feel abrupt and manipulative.  
- Relies on melodrama instead of character‑driven inevitability.

### Where the Crawdads Sing — Emotional Shortcuts  
- Early conflict hinges on an avoidable situation the film doesn’t justify.  
- Ending uses flashforwards as a shortcut to sentimentality rather than earned catharsis.  
- Social and psychological logic is assumed, not shown.

### Bridge of Spies — Drama Without Stakes  
- Presents obstacles that dissolve the moment the protagonist politely asks for help.  
- No resistance, no tension, no meaningful conflict.  
- A long film with the dramatic intensity of watching a tin of beans rotate in a microwave.

## Pattern Observed  
- I value **earned emotion**, **earned tension**, and **earned spectacle**.  
- I reject films that rely on **narrative shortcuts**, **contrived obstacles**, or **philosophical posturing**.  
- Perspective, structure, and dramatic integrity matter more than genre or theme.

## My Take  
These films clarify my taste: I want cinema that respects the audience by building its effects honestly.  
When a film commits to its perspective and earns its emotional beats (like *Godzilla 2014*), I’m fully engaged.  
When it leans on shortcuts, sentimentality, or unearned gravitas, I disengage immediately.
