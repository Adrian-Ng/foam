## Core Idea  
The film presents itself as a tense moral drama, but repeatedly removes all tension by allowing the protagonist to overcome every obstacle simply by asking someone else to fix it for him.

## Key Points  

### 1. Expectation Mismatch  
Marketed like a meaty courtroom or Cold War thriller, the film instead becomes a procedural negotiation story with almost no dramatic friction.

### 2. Obstacles Without Resistance  
Whenever Donovan encounters a barrier, he politely asks someone to remove it — and they do.  
This pattern repeats so consistently that obstacles stop feeling real.

### 3. No Stakes, No Tension  
If the protagonist can obtain anything he needs through polite requests, then nothing is at risk.  
The narrative never forces him into genuine conflict, sacrifice, or ingenuity.

### 4. Drama Vacuum  
The film gestures at moral weight and geopolitical danger, but the storytelling never generates pressure, urgency, or emotional consequence.

### 5. Viewer Experience  
The absence of meaningful resistance makes the film feel long, flat, and dramatically inert.

## My Take  
The film wants to be a principled thriller about doing the right thing under pressure, but it never creates any actual pressure.  
Every obstacle evaporates the moment Donovan asks someone to fix it, leaving the story devoid of stakes.  
Heating a tin of beans in a microwave — and worrying about the metal — would have offered more tension than this entire film.
