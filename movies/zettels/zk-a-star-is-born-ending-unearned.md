## Core Idea  
The film attempts a tragic ending without establishing the emotional, psychological, or relational groundwork needed to make it feel inevitable or meaningful.

## Key Points  

### 1. Lack of Interiority  
Jackson’s inner world is never explored beyond surface symptoms.  
We see behaviour, but not the emotional logic behind it.

### 2. Underdeveloped Relationship Arc  
The film assumes the audience will *feel* the depth of Jackson and Ally’s bond.  
But it doesn’t build shared values, intimacy, or growth — only vibes.

### 3. Addiction as Aesthetic  
Addiction is treated as a mood, not a system.  
There’s no sense of patterns, triggers, consequences, or recovery cycles.

### 4. Tragedy Without Buildup  
The suicide functions as a dramatic device rather than a character-driven outcome.  
It feels abrupt, unearned, and disconnected from the narrative’s emotional spine.

### 5. Weak Identity Reinforcement  
Sparse use of character names reduces intimacy and audience connection.  
Names matter — they anchor relationships.

## My Take  
The film wants the emotional weight of a classical tragedy, but it doesn’t do the narrative labour to justify it.  
Without psychological continuity or relational depth, the ending lands like a twist rather than the culmination of a coherent arc.
