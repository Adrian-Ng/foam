## Core Idea  
Conflict is the engine of narrative momentum.  
Without meaningful resistance, characters cannot grow and stories cannot move.

---

## Key Points  
- Conflict arises when a character’s goal meets **opposition**.  
- Opposition must be **credible**, **persistent**, and **costly**.  
- Conflict forces characters to make choices that reveal who they are.  
- Removing conflict removes tension, stakes, and emotional investment.

---

## Patterns  
- Stories fail when obstacles are removed by external convenience.  
- Strong conflict emerges from **values**, **desires**, and **limitations** colliding.
