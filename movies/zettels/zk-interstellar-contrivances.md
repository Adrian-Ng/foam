## Core Idea  
The film relies on extreme coincidences and character decisions that break plausibility, making its emotional and scientific ambitions feel unearned.

## Key Points  

### 1. Unbelievable Coincidences  
The plot hinges on Cooper randomly driving through the countryside and accidentally discovering the last remnants of NASA hidden in a secret underground base.  
This removes agency and undermines the story’s stakes.

### 2. Implausible Character Logic  
The moment Michael Caine’s character tells Cooper, “You’re the best pilot we ever had,” the film breaks its own internal logic.  
A fully functioning space program just happens to need the random man who stumbled into their bunker.

### 3. Contrived Recruitment  
Instead of a grounded, earned setup, the film uses coincidence as a shortcut to get Cooper into the mission.  
This makes the entire premise feel arbitrary rather than inevitable.

### 4. People Don’t Behave Like This  
Characters accept absurd situations with no skepticism, no resistance, and no emotional realism.  
Human behaviour is treated as a puzzle piece to move the plot forward.

### 5. Pretension Without Coherence  
The movie aims for philosophical and emotional depth, but the foundation is so contrived that the big ideas feel hollow rather than profound.

## My Take  
*Interstellar* wants to be a sweeping, emotional, scientifically ambitious epic, but it’s built on a series of unbelievable coincidences and character choices that no real person would make.  
When the story asks me to accept that the man who randomly discovers a secret NASA base is also their best pilot, I check out.  
The film’s grandiosity collapses under the weight of its own contrivances.
