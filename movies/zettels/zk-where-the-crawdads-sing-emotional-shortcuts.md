## Core Idea  
The film relies on emotional shortcuts — early‑plot contrivances and end‑of‑story flashforwards — instead of building the psychological and social groundwork needed to earn its emotional beats.

## Key Points  

### 1. Reportable Early Incident  
The central conflict depends on an early event that, in a realistic world, Kya could have reported.  
The film doesn’t establish the **social**, **psychological**, or **situational** logic that would make reporting impossible.  
This makes the conflict feel **contrived** rather than character‑driven.

### 2. Weak Social Context  
The narrative assumes total isolation and distrust of authority, but doesn’t *show* these conditions early enough for the audience to internalise them.  
The worldbuilding arrives too late to justify Kya’s choices.

### 3. Flashforward Manipulation  
The ending uses flashforwards to generate sentimentality without earning it through character development or thematic buildup.  
This is a classic **[narrative shortcut](copilot-action://composer-send?text=What%20are%20narrative%20shortcuts%20in%20storytelling)** — a structural device standing in for emotional labour.

### 4. Tone Mismatch  
The film tries to retroactively reframe itself as bittersweet and reflective, but the emotional groundwork for that tone never materialises.  
The shift feels imposed rather than emergent.

## My Take  
The film wants to evoke deep emotion, but instead of building the internal and external logic that would make those emotions resonate, it leans on structural devices — an avoidable early conflict and a sentimental flashforward ending.  
The result feels **manipulative rather than moving**.
