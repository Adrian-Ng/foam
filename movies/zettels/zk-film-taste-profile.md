## Core Idea  
My taste in film is defined by a preference for earned emotion, grounded perspective, and coherent dramatic logic — and a rejection of contrivance, artificial urgency, and emotional flatness.

## What I Value  

### 1. Earned Emotion  
I respond strongly to films that build emotional impact through character psychology, narrative development, and thematic coherence.

### 2. Human-Scale Perspective  
I prefer films that anchor spectacle in lived experience, using perspective to create awe, tension, and immersion.

### 3. Competent, Engaging Protagonists  
Characters who are smart, capable, and psychologically coherent draw me in.

### 5. Mystery and Momentum  
I enjoy stories that unfold through earned clues, reversals, and discoveries — not arbitrary twists.

## What I Reject  

### 1. Contrivance  
Coincidences, arbitrary leaps, or plot devices that break narrative plausibility.

### 2. Emotional Flatness  
Characters who react to major events with indifference, removing tension and humanity.

### 3. Artificial Urgency  
Editing or music that simulates intensity without narrative stakes.

### 4. Structural Gimmicks  
Timelines, puzzles, or conceptual frameworks that replace character-driven drama.

### 5. Bureaucratic or Procedural “Drama”  
Stories that mistake administrative conflict for emotional stakes.

## My Take  
My taste is consistent: I want films that respect the audience by earning their effects — emotional, cinematic, or thematic.  
I disengage from films that rely on shortcuts, contrivances, or stylistic noise to create the illusion of depth or tension.

This profile explains why I love films like *Godzilla (2014)* and *Jack Reacher*, and why I reject films like *Interstellar*, *Oppenheimer*, and *A Star Is Born*.
