## Core Idea  
Mythic storytelling frames characters or forces as larger-than-life entities whose actions shape the world, not just the plot.

---

## Key Points  
- Uses scale, symbolism, and archetype.  
- Characters may represent **forces**, **institutions**, or **natural phenomena**.  
- Works best when grounded in human perspective for contrast.  
- Creates awe, inevitability, and thematic resonance.

---

## Patterns  
- Mythic framing often appears in monster films, epics, and tragedies.  
- It requires restraint — overexposure breaks the illusion.
