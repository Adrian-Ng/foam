## Core Idea  
Narrative stakes define what a character stands to lose, gain, or transform.  
Without stakes, a story has no weight, urgency, or emotional consequence.

---

## Key Points  
- Stakes can be **personal**, **moral**, **physical**, **social**, or **psychological**.  
- Stakes must be **felt** by the audience, not just stated.  
- Stakes require **resistance** — obstacles that cannot be bypassed through convenience.  
- When stakes are weak, tension collapses and the story becomes inert.

---

## Patterns  
- Films often fail when they present obstacles that evaporate on contact.  
- Strong stakes emerge from **irreversible choices** and **meaningful consequences**.
